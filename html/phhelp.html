<H2><A NAME="1"></A>About the Physunits toolbox</H2>
<P>The Physunits toolbox is an attempt to confer dimensional
&lsquo;awareness&rsquo; to the MATLAB environment. The motivation for
this, as well as a suggested way to go about it, are explained in
<I>Automated computation and consistency checking of physical
dimensions and units in scientific programs</I>, Petty, G.W.,
Software - Practice and Experience, (Volume 31, Issue 11, 19 June
2001)
</P>
<P>The author of the same has also made available for download a
FORTRAN 90 module that implements this idea in the FORTRAN language.
The module and paper can be downloaded from
<A HREF="http://rain.aos.wisc.edu/~gpetty/physunits.html">http://rain.aos.wisc.edu/~gpetty/physunits.html</A>
.
</P>
<P>The Physunits toolbox is based on the above module, and expands
it, while trying to adhere consistently to MATLAB standards and
practices.
</P>
<H2><A NAME="2"></A>How it works</H2>
<P>The PHYSUNITS toolbox works by defining the PREAL class, with a
PREAL data type and overloaded functions to support it. An object of
type PREAL represents a physical quantity. It has two fields:
</P>
<UL>
    <LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><TT>value</TT> - The numerical
    value, which must be a numerical type with zero imaginary part.
    </P>
    <LI><P><TT>units</TT> - A vector of 7 numbers, representing the
    physical dimensions associated with <TT>value</TT>.
    </P>
</UL>
<P>The format for the <TT>units</TT> vector is [<FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace">length</FONT>,
<TT>mass</TT>, <TT>time</TT>, <TT>temperature</TT>, <TT>electric
current</TT>, <TT>amount of matter</TT>, <TT>luminous intensity</TT>],
but this format is usually transparent to the user, who defines her
variables via an interface structure.
</P>
<P>The overloaded functions and operators are then responsible for
enforcing consistency in all operations involving PREAL variables. In
particular:
</P>
<UL>
    <LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Addition of two variables is only
    possible if they have the same dimensions.
    </P>
    <LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Exponents must be dimensionless.
    </P>
    <LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Transcendental functions accept
    dimensionless arguments only.
    </P>
    <LI><P>Binary logical operations can only be performed on variables
    having the same dimensions.
    </P>
</UL>
<H2><A NAME="6"></A>Using the PREAL class</H2>
<P>The PREAL class constructor accepts two arguments: a scalar real
number, and a vector of 7 real numbers; and creates a PREAL object
using these arguments for the value and units fields. This is a
cumbersome and error prone method but, fortunately, the user will
rarely need to use it directly. Instead she calls the function
<TT>setUnits</TT>, which returns an interface structure that greatly
facilitates the definition and use of dimensioned variables.
</P>
<P>The interface structure contains predefined variables of type
PREAL, representing the basic SI units as well as many other units,
derived units, constants of nature, parameters, etc. Get this
structure by calling the <FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace">setUnits</FONT>
function. Once this interface structure is present in your workspace,
you can the use the predefined variables. Define new PREAL variables
by multiplying a predefined PREAL by a DOUBLE.</P>
<P STYLE="background: #c0c0c0">Tip: In Matlab version 7 (R14) or
higher use the auto completion feature to find  the names of
predefined variables. If you have the output of the <FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace">setUnits</FONT>
function in the variable <FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace">y</FONT>,
type <FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace">y</FONT> in the command line
followed by a period (.), then hit TAB to get a list of all variables
contained in <FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace">y</FONT>. Type the
first characters in a variable name and hit TAB again to narrow down
the search.</P>
<H2><A NAME="8"></A>Examples</H2>
<P>In the command window, get the interface structure by calling
<FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace">setUnits</FONT>:</P>
<PRE CLASS="codeinput" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">si=setUnits;</PRE><P>
Create PREAL variables by multiplying double literals with the
predefined unit variables:</P>
<PRE CLASS="codeinput" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">x=2*si.meter

x =

  2 m

dr=1e-3*si.m

dr =

  0.001 m

F=12*si.newton

F =

  12 m kg s^-2
 </PRE><P>
Operations on PREAL types follow the rules of physical dimensions:</P>
<PRE CLASS="codeinput" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">x^2

ans =

  4 m^2

x+dr

ans =

  2.001 m

sin(dr/x)
ans =

  5.0000e-004

F*dr

ans =

  0.012 m^2 kg s^-2
 </PRE><P>
You can use the <TT>double</TT> function to convert a preal variable
to a double. (This function simply discards the <TT>units</TT> field
of the variable.)
</P>
<PRE CLASS="codeinput" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">fprintf('Work done is %g joules.\n',double(F*dr))
Work done is 0.012 joules.</PRE><P>
Attempting an illegal operation results in an error:</P>

<PRE CLASS="codeinput">fprintf('One joule equals %g ergs.\n',double(si.joule/si.erg))
fprintf('One dyne equals %g Newtons.\n',double(si.dyne/si.newton))

One dyne equals 1e-005 Newtons.</PRE><H2>

<P>A short sample program that demonstrates the PREAL class can be

<H2><A NAME="21"></A>Extending the Physunits toolbox</H2>
<P>Anyone who will use the Physunits toolbox will undoubtedly
discover that new capabilities need to be added. More than likely,
these will include more functions that need to be overloaded for the
PREAL class. If you get an error message from MATLAB complaining that
function so-and-so is not defined for class PREAL, then you should
simply define it for the PREAL class by putting an m-file with the
same name in the <TT>@preal</TT> directory. For example, the function
<TT>sin</TT> is defined for the PREAL class. Take a look in the file
<TT>sin.m</TT> that resides in the <TT>@preal</TT> directory to see
how it is defined. With this function as a reference it should not be
difficult to define the <TT>asin</TT> function also for the PREAL
class should you find it necessary.
</P>
<P>Another improvement you are likely to need is the addition of more
predefined variables used often in your work. This may be done by
editing the <TT>setUnits</TT> function, and adding the required
definitions at the end of the file.
</P>
<H2><A NAME="22"></A>Disabling the Physunits toolbox</H2>
<P>Using physical units in calculations is helpful and natural for
scientists and engineers, but the need to use a user-defined type
instead of the standard DOUBLE class comes with a penalty on
performance. Long calculations involving PREAL variables may become
too slow. A way to &lsquo;switch off&rsquo; the dimensional awareness
of the code is therefore desirable. Converting all PREAL variables
into doubles with the <TT>double</TT> function is not practical.
Instead, use the <TT>physunits</TT> function with the 'off' flag at
the beginning of your code.
</P>
<PRE CLASS="codeinput" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">physunits off
PHYSUNITS disabled.</PRE><P>
This causes all <I>subsequent</I> variables defined as PREALs in the
code to be treated as regular double variables. The rest of the code
should run exactly as it would were it written without any use of
PREALs.
</P>
<P>The recommended practice is therefore to use PREAL variables with
physical dimensions throughout the code, enjoying the benefits of
automatic consistency checks, dimensional tracking, and dimensional
display, during development and debugging. When the code is ready for
the &lsquo;operational&rsquo; run, a one-line command at the
beginning will restore performance and efficiency to optimal.
</P>
<p>
An alternative that works equally well is to change calls to <TT>setUnits</TT>
(typically a single call per application!) into calls to <TT>setFUnits</TT> which
returns a structure with the same fields but as type <TT>DOUBLE</TT>. This single
character modification allows you to deploy code developed and debugged with the aid
of the toolbox to users who don't wish to install it at all.

%%
% The PHYSUNITS toolbox works by defining the PREAL class, with a PREAL

% PREAL represents a physical quantity. It has two fields:
%%
% * |value| - The numerical value, which must be a numerical type with

% * |units| - A vector of 7 numbers, representing the physical dimensions
% associated with |value|.
%
% The format for the |units| vector is [|length|,
% |mass|, |time|, |temperature|, |electric current|, |amount of matter|,
% |luminous intensity|],
% but this format is usually transparent to the user, who defines her
% variables via an interface structure.
%

% * Addition of two variables is only possible if they have the same
% dimensions.
% * Exponents must be dimensionless.
% * Trancendental functions accept dimensionless arguments only.
% * Binary logical operations can only be perfomed on variables having the

%% Using the PREAL class
%%
% The PREAL class constructor accepts two arguments: a scalar real number,
% and a vector of 7 real numbers; and creates a PREAL object using these

%
% The interface structure contains predefined variables of type PREAL,
% representing the basic SI units as well as many other units,
% derived units, constants of nature, parameters, etc. Get this
% structure by calling the setUnits function. Once this interface
% structure is present in your workspace, you can the use the predefined
% variables.

%% Examples
%%
% In the command window, get the interface structure by calling setSIUnits:
si=setUnits;
%%
% Create PREAL variables by multiplying double literals with the predefined
% unit variables:
x=2*si.meter
%%
dr=1e-3*si.m
%%
F=12*si.newton
%%
% Operations on PREAL types follow the rules of physical dimensions:
x^2
%%
x+dr
%%
sin(dr/x)
%%
F*dr
%%
% You can use the |double| function to convert a preal variable to a
% double. (This function simply discards the |units| field of the variable.)
fprintf('Work done is %g joules.\n',double(F*dr))
%%
% Attempting an illegal operation results in an error:
%x+F
%%
% Notice that, as a bonus, the physunits toolbox can be used as a unit
% converter.
fprintf('One joule equals %g ergs.\n',double(si.joule/si.erg))
fprintf('One dyne equals %g Newtons.\n',double(si.dyne/si.newton))

%% Sample program
% A short sample program that demonstrates the PREAL class can be found in
% |...\physunits\iceball.m|.

%% Extending the Physunits toolbox
% Anyone who will use the Physunits toolbox will undoubtedly discover that
% new capabilities need to be added. More than likely, these will include
% more functions that need to be overloaded for the PREAL class. If you get
% an error message from MATLAB complaining that function so-and-so is not
% defined for class PREAL, then you should simply define it for the PREAL
% class by putting an m-file with the same name in the |@preal| directory.
% For example, the function |sin| is defined for the PREAL class. Take a
